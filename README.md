## Introduction

Introducing the Logo Generator – your hassle-free solution for creating simple and professional logos. As a freelance web developer, you can now effortlessly generate unique logos for your projects without the need for a graphic designer. Enjoy the convenience of personalized logos tailored to your color, shape, and text specifications up with up to three shapes, three letters, and over one hundred colors! See the provided usage and program tutorial to begin.

## Usage

Download the project from the provided GitHub repository and then navigate to the directory where your downloaded project is located by using the command line in your device's terminal. Execute the program by entering "node index.js" or type the command "npm start." A series of questions will follow to aid the logo generation process, prompting you to provide input. In case you input an invalid color keyword, hexadecimal number, or invalid text length, the system will guide you to retry the process to the defined keywords and hexadecimals.
